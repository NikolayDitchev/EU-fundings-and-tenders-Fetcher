Description: 
Objective:This call topic aims to support the retrofit of a marine fishing vessel to demonstrate the feasibility of using alternative propulsion technology(ies) and other solutions to improve the energy and emissions performance of the vessel, and to fill gaps in information and knowledge on the potential and compatibility of technologies for the fishing sector. 
Scope:This call topic focuses on the retrofit of a demonstration fishing vessel to reduce emissions and improve its energy performance. Activities can include assessment of feasibility, testing, retrofitting, sea trials, assessment of results and communication and promotion of the demonstrated solutions.Please see section 2 of the call document for further information on the activities that can be funded.
Expected Impact:The expected impacts include:To develop and demonstrate viable solutions for fishing vessels which improve the energy performance, including reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and costs.To increase knowledge on the challenges, benefits and impacts (including economic, environmental and in terms of health and safety of fishers) of different technologies aimed to improve the energy and emissions performance of fishing vessels.To strengthen understanding of the potential to adapt existing technologies to the fishing sector.To raise awareness of and broaden the possibilities offered to fishers to become more energy efficient and initiate the energy transition of fishing vessels. Long term expected impacts include:Improving the resilience and economic viability of the EU fishing fleet.Improving understanding of technical, social, legal, regulatory and policy barriers to energy transition in fisheries.Reduced fuel consumption and GHG emissions from fishing vessels and improved energy efficiency in their range of activities.Accelerating the adoption of new technologies in the fisheries to foster energy transition.Improving the business environment and raising awareness among investors.

Description: 
ExpectedOutcome:Projects’ results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:More efficient interactions among the scientific community, research institutions and programmes, first and second responders, city’s risk managers of major crises and citizens or local communities for an enhanced coordination of the disaster risk management cycle and governance (including knowledge transfer and awareness of innovative solutions) from international to local levels, fostering a faster transfer of results from science into practice. 
Scope:Under the Open Topic, proposals are welcome to address new, upcoming or unforeseen challenges and/or creative or disruptive solutions for enhanced interactions among the scientific community, practitioners, city’s risk managers of major crises and citizens or local communities in the event of (natural or man-made) disasters, that are not covered by the other topics of Calls Disaster-Resilient Society 2021-2022, Call Disaster-Resilient Society 2023 and Call Disaster-Resilient Society 2024. For example, proposals may address situational awareness of disaster-related risks by citizens, near-to-real-cases exercises (demonstrations simulating real cases) involving citizen volunteers, municipal authorities and first responders, advisory dissemination materials, highlighting good practices of interactions among citizens, municipal authorities and first and second responders in the event of (natural or man-made) disasters, addressed to European public in different EU languages, etc.Adapted to the nature, scope and type of proposed projects, proposals should convincingly explain how they will plan and/or carry out demonstration, testing or validation of developed tools and solutions. Proposals should also delineate the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national and EU level for possible next steps after the research project.Research proposals should consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other Framework Programmes’ projects. When applicable, the successful proposal should build on the publicly available achievements and findings of related previous national or EU-funded projects.

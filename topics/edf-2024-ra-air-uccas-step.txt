Description: 
Objective:It is an overarching challenge for the EU and EDF Associated Countries to develop a consolidated common perspective on the long-term applications, requirements, solution concepts and technology needs for an advanced EU Unmanned Collaborative Combat Aircraft (U-CCA) system to support the 5th and 6th generation fighter in a highly contested A2/AD environment, also in regards to interoperability with NATO.U-CCA systems could be conceived as unmanned aerial multirole systems, part of a System of System (SoS), aimed at combined air operations, which are able to act in teaming with lower autonomy levels agents and manned platforms in order to execute tasks in various operational scenarios, while revealing extended survivability capability.Although development studies have been underway for some time in the main European aeronautical companies, with the financial support of the respective EU Member States and EDF Associated Countries, the added value of this topic lies in the development of a common vision for a U-CCA system and its related high-level requirements.Specific objectiveThis topic aims to explore technologies, concepts, products, processes and services related to U-CCA systems in different possible configurations. These U-CCA systems are expected to be combat ready, hence highly manoeuvrable and, depending on the mission assigned, they should also be able to collect multispectral information from large areas, while identifying and countering potential threats in a wide range of missions including, but not limited to, defensive and offensive counter air, anti-surface warfare (ASuW) and suppression/destruction of enemy air defences (SEAD/DEAD), in a highly contested environment.The U-CCA system should therefore be characterised by a high degree of autonomy and operational effectiveness, a large reconfigurable payload capacity and a flight envelope that allows teaming with fighters, including, but not limited to, with 5th and 6th generation, and support to other future aerial platforms in the context of a SoS approach for future combined air operations, including its expendability in specific imputable scenarios. 
Scope:Proposals must address feasibility studies and preliminary design to explore new/improved concepts, configurations, mission architectures, flight and mission functions, disruptive technologies related to U-CCA systems, and trusted autonomy levels for effective networked operations including manned-unmanned teaming (MUM-T) in demanding denied/contested environments.Types of activitiesThe following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and whether they are mandatory or optional (see Article 10(3) EDF Regulation):          Types of activities (art 10(3) EDF Regulation)      Eligible?

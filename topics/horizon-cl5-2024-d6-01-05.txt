Description: 
ExpectedOutcome:Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:Extended and up to date CCAM Knowledge Base[1], including CCAM projects, demonstration and deployment initiatives, standards, facilitating the exchange of best practices and the deployment of CCAM services.Well established network of experts and forum for stakeholders in the different thematic R&amp;I fields of CCAM.Strong collaboration and cooperation between all CCAM stakeholders through effective collaboration mechanisms fostering exchanges of results from projects and CCAM initiatives, in terms of practices, experiences, tools and methodologies supporting the transition to large-scale deployment.Increased and high-quality exchanges and cooperation between the EU Member States/Associated countries,EU CCAM common evaluation methodology (EU-CEM) widely used in Europe.Good level of understanding and awareness of CCAM among citizens, decision and policy makers in Europe. 
Scope:A common basis for CCAM Knowledge in Europe is available today with the online CCAM Knowledge Base[2] which constitutes a one stop shop for all relevant R&amp;I initiatives, tools, methodologies, regulations and standards in the field. Targeted content will be available for some stakeholder categories. The Knowledge Base should be expanded and further adapted to the needs of all relevant stakeholders. Results and lessons learned from the EU, national and international projects should be made available and accessible to targeted user groups. Proposed actions should in particular provide support for stakeholders to move into operations by identifying key building blocks and standards for deploying pilot services and enable capacity building for key actors of different use cases /applications domains as well as for citizens and non-experts on how to use CCAM systems and services and to become aware of new developments and related risks.The EU Common Evaluation Methodology (EU-CEM) developed in project “FAME” funded under CL5-2021-D6-01-06[3] aims at becoming the basic methodology for all CCAM related evaluations to support collaboration, exchange and harmonisation. The methodology will need to be implemented for existing and innovative use cases by CCAM projects and aligned with national mobility strategies and approaches. Training programmes for CCAM projects will be necessary to integrate the methodology and to collect feedback on lessons learned during its implementation.A States Representatives Group (SRG)[4] has been created within the CCAM Partnership to ensure a continuous dialogue at European and national level for the sharing of information on CCAM R&amp;I to increase coordination between European and national R&amp;I funding schemes, and among national programmes. To carry out its mission efficiently, the SRG will need support to collect and analyse information on national R&amp;I initiatives and to implement cooperation activities.To successfully contribute to the expected outcomes, proposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects:  Ensure the maintenance and expansion of the Knowledge Base to support the CCAM stakeholder community and CCAM Partnership for the identification of future needs for R&amp;I, testing and demonstration initiatives and for moving into operations (minimum block requirements, standards and common definitions to run pilot services across Europe). The content of the Knowledge Base should support the monitoring of the progress made on the targets and impacts set by the CCAM Partnership[5]. More specifically, the proposed action should regularly collect from the CCAM Partnership projects the data and information needed to track the KPIs set out in the CCAM SRIA[6], using a survey developed and maintained in agreement with the Partnership.Identify further needs for targeted content for specific stakeholder categories and in particular, develop content that is accessible to non-experts, thereby supporting capacity building of the general public. The proposed action should define the above-mentioned stakeholder categories, and develop a subsequent communication strategy (content, material, media, etc.) using realistic and accessible terms to address different target groups (including non-experts).Provide effective dissemination and concertation mechanisms and means for the stakeholder community (e.g., workshops, symposia, international cooperation, capacity building content for non-experts) and organise the EUCAD2027 event (as a conference with a side exhibition and demonstration site) together with the European Commission and the CCAM Partnership, to enable the exchange of experiences and practices, stimulate collaboration and cooperation between all CCAM stakeholders (including at international level) and reach consensus on challenges and future R&amp;I needs within the thematic clusters of the Partnership.Facilitate the work of the CCAM SRG and stimulate the cooperation between EU Member States/Associated Countries for improved coordination of activities in the areas identified as priorities by the SRG. Provide an analysis of initiatives in EU Member States/Associated countries and support the SRG in identifying areas for R&amp;I cooperation.Ensure representation of European stakeholders in international cooperation, information exchange and harmonisation initiatives on CCAM. Provide a global output on CCAM activities to support the development of European agendas by exploring potential opportunities and R&amp;I domains for international cooperation.Continue to evaluate and update the EU-CEM through targeted discussions with EU Member States/Associated countries in order to align the CEM with national mobility strategies and regulations, also looking at both national and regional transport and mobility data to ensure compatibility.Support the practical implementation of the EU-CEM (for existing and innovative use-cases) and provide training programmes for CCAM projects to integrate the methodology.Assess the level of awareness and attitudes of European citizens, decision- and policy makers about CCAM as well as their intention to use through regular surveys and workshops. Results should be published in the Knowledge Base and mechanisms should be provided to integrate findings into the EU-CEM. A link should be established with existing survey initiatives in place at EU and Member States’/Associated countries’ levels. This action should be grounded in a co-creative process. In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries.This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.

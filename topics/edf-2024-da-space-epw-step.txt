Description: 
Objective:In today’s military applications supported by satellite communications, security, information assurance and link efficiency are inextricably linked. Military operations are becoming more complex as conflict areas grow more dispersed on a global scale, with a growing need to support a diversity of on-the-move, on-the-pause and fixed platforms. At the same time, security threats are becoming more apparent, raising concerns that nations, terrorist groups, criminals and individual hackers can jam, interrupt and endanger military operations.In satellite communications, most individual nations cannot generate significant capabilities by themselves. Instead, European nations can generate increased capabilities through cooperation and collaboration. Several pooling and sharing initiatives have already been kicked off in the European defence context to face challenges related to the fragmentation of supply and demand, the assured secure access to satellite communications and the changing environment.The complexity of dispersed military operations translates into requirements to have access to complex global satellite communication networks with a mix of different satellite constellations, networks and services to support a wide variety of military applications. Security and resilience are key features of today’s military satellite networks and are paired with efficiency to cope with the increased data demand of bandwidth hungry services such as ISR and situational awareness, the growing use of on-the-move applications, and the need for seamless end-user experience during operations. However, military satellite communication networks with these wide-ranging requirements face an increased risk of ill-intentioned acts and cyber-attacks such as jamming, signal spoofing and interception attempts.A key element to tackle this security challenge is the implementation of a protected, resilient and secure satellite communication waveform for fully transparent, processed transparent and the new generation processed interactive transponders, which at the same time responds to the operational requirements and allows for interoperability during joint operations with allies.The great majority of Member States do not have independent access to secure satellite communication waveforms, although they also engage in military operations in a national or multinational (EU, NATO, UN peacekeeping, etc.) context. The investment for developing a protected waveform cannot be carried out by a single nation alone and requires a multinational development approach in a European context with the aim to establish a European Protected Waveform (EPW).Specific objectiveThis topic aims specifically at further developing a European interoperable protected waveform for satellite military communications that can be used by different EU nations individually or together in a joint operational context (EU, NATO, multi-nation missions). Such European Protected Waveform (EPW) should in particular target efficiency, security, affordability and interoperability of satellite communications. The EPW should be license-based and flexibly adapted according to the application, service or platform (fixed, on-the-move or on-the-pause) during peacetime or in operations.Next to the waveform, related technologies should be developed to increase the security and resilience (via integrated multi-layered approach) and adopt the EPW on on-board processing satellites as well as to cater for next-generation technologies.The targeted development should therefore be undertaken with five key considerations in mind:1/ European autonomy and cooperation between Member States The EPW should be capable of increasing the autonomy of Europe and of reducing the dependence on non-European satellite communication technologies for military operations with mission critical and sensitive information. At the same time, it should allow for interoperability between EU nations in a joint operational context to support the exchange of mission critical information and improve the efficiency of the operations.2/ Affordable and efficient satellite services The EPW should be affordable and include the latest efficiency satellite communication waveform, networking and equipment technologies to save OPEX (reduce bandwidth costs, require less resources for planning) and CAPEX (reduce equipment cost) compared to current existing expensive (proprietary) military satellite modems. The EPW should include already available innovative Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) satellite communication technologies (e.g., DVB-S2X waveform standard) in combination with the latest security and resilience technologies. There should no longer be a trade-off between the efficiency of the waveform and security. As such, high throughput demands should be achieved even with small satellite terminals using a limited amount of satellite bandwidth.3/ Flexibility and scalability The EPW should be portable on different modems with different form factors (board, modem, terminal), different platforms (fixed, on-the-move, on-the-pause) and be used across multiple types of satellite communication networks, different types of satellite constellations (LEO, MEO, GEO, HEO, high-throughput satellites, spot beams, regional and global beams), transponders (fully transparent-, processed transparent- and processed interactive, including software defined radio ones) and different network architectures (VSAT, point-to-point, mesh). At the same time, the EPW should be operational in different satellite frequency bands (at least C-band, X-band, Ku-band and Ka-band) and exchange, broadcast, multicast, unicast or relay a large range of satellite services and applications, including those requiring low latency, from low to very high data rates.4/ Innovation The EPW development should not just be a copy and paste of existing waveform solutions, licenses and technologies. The EPW proposal should be ambitious and innovative, combining the individual strengths of different nations and different members in the European satellite communication industry. The EPW programme should be open to support future requirements and capabilities needed.5/ Security and resilience The main feature of the EPW should be the increase in protection and resilience of the waveform to ensure secure information exchange over satellite for mission critical communications. Based on different threat analysis and Concept of Operations (CONOPS) definitions, the EPW development should focus on building satellite links that are resistant to electronic- and cyber-attacks, such as jamming, signal spoofing, eavesdropping and interception attempts. In addition, satellite link outages caused by rain fade, atmospheric and extra-atmospheric (relevant space weather events) conditions, or on-the-move communication challenges should be reduced to a minimum. The EPW activity should investigate how different security levels can be offered towards different military end users depending on their security requirements, their daily operations and the budgets available.

The demarcation point is the edge router of the satellite network which connects the hubs, gateways and modems with outside networks or the internet.Additionally, it should be feasible to implement the EPW also on existing and operational telecommunication satellites;The EPW should be resilient and maximise service availability to ensure continuity of seamless operations;The EPW should have performances considering the throughput demands of today and the future;The EPW should support pooling and sharing service models of both waveform and equipment that can be implemented for different operations;The EPW should apply to the best extent possible the set of applicable standards of 5G non-terrestrial network (5G NTN) within 3GPP and take into account the new use cases and technologies linked to Machine-to-Machine (M2M), Internet-of-Things (IoT), orchestration, cloud-services, the connected soldier and smart defence.

As such, an overall approach needs to be envisaged to align the EPW development with the complementary security and resiliency technologies for ground and space segments, leading to the following additional requirements:The EPW should be integrated into a larger multi-layered security &amp; resilience architecture that:Contains anti-jamming technologies that allow to detect, mitigate, prevent and predict jamming efforts by 3rd party adversaries. This could be tackled through spectrum monitoring, geolocation and network management technologies working together with nulling or interference excision technologies as well as Anti-Jam waveform capabilities as Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum, Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum and beam forming technologies;Allows for network diversity, redundancy and geo-redundancy technologies to increase the resilience of the satellite network as well as for multi-access capabilities (hybrid LTE/5G/etc.) with intelligent routing;Can dynamically steer its radiation pattern accordingly to connect to another satellite in a different frequency and satellite orbit to increase network resiliency. Fixed, on-the-move and on-the-pause land-based and maritime terminals, man packs and antenna systems, including airborne terminals and antenna systems installed on rotatory wings (RW), need to be considered as well as different types of antenna technologies (e.g., parabolic, electronically steered, phased array, flat antennas, etc.). The secure connection and interface between antenna system and baseband needs to be taken into account as well;Includes network and ground segment technologies that improve the cyber hardening of all satellite vulnerable subsystems including protection against possible hacking, network intrusion, etc.Includes protection technologies against hostile action (e.g., jammers, intrusion and eavesdropping) for critical satellite datalinks, improving signals protection and integrity;Provides future proof interfaces and complementarity to upcoming disruptive security technologies such as quantum-safe encryption, self-healing networks, etc.;Is open towards upcoming and existing EU-based pooling and sharing programs (e.g., GovSatCom) and satellite constellations (EU Secure Space Connectivity System initiative currently under study) and ready to be integrated in these concepts.

The flexibility and the affordability of the terminal are key considerations.A Software Defined Mode type of baseband equipment should be pursued;The baseband infrastructure (hubs and modems) should cover multiple architecture types of networks (point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, mesh) and satellite (wideband, spot beam, mix of both, transparent, processed) architectures;The EPW should operate on Software Defined hardware from different vendors to be selected by nations, government and defence agencies or institutions, depending on their preference or acquisition processes;The EPW should include the ability to receive and transmit various modulation methods using a common set of hardware;The EPW should be future-proof, easy to upgrade and change configurations (over-the-air) and offer the ability to alter functionality by downloading and running new software at will, in order to repurpose the modem for new applications;The EPW should be affordable and include the latest efficiency satellite waveform, networking and equipment technologies to save OPEX (reduce bandwidth costs, save resources for planning) and CAPEX (save on equipment cost) compared to existing expensive military satellite modems;The EPW should consider Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) constraints for on-the-pause and on-the-move platforms and unmanned systems.

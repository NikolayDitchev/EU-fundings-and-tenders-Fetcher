Description: 
Objective:4. CERV-2024-CITIZENS-REM-EUINTEGRATION - European integration and its defining achievementsEuropean integration has substantially transformed the life of Europeans. While it has provided new opportunities for cross border travel, study and work, it has also affected the identities of people who more and more feel European as part of their identity. European integration has progressively advanced and protected the rights of people in all EU countries, rights that are often taken for granted now. However, apart from being an institutional process, European integration has been built and advanced by different people and movements at different moments. From the Ventotene manifesto to the Congress of Europe, the foundation for European integration has a long history.The projects under this priority should explore and promote to all generations the defining moments and reference points of European integration, its history, and how these changes have in practice affected the daily lives of Europeans. Projects can focus on specific rights granted in the European Union such as freedom of movement, on specific achievements such as a common currency, or on defining moments such as accession of countries. Testimonies of witnesses could be a particular valuable resource for making the experience tangible and provide an intergenerational perspective.For further information about the call and its conditions, please see the Call document.

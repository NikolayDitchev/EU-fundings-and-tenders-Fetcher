Description: 
Objective:This call for proposals concerns LIFE Operating Grant Framework Partnership Agreements (FPA OG).Applicants to the LIFE-2024-NGO-OG-FPA call for proposals MUST ALSO APPLY under the LIFE-2024-NGO-OG-SGA Call for proposals to be considered for an operating grant for FY2025. 
Scope:Framework Partnership Agreements (FPAs) under the LIFE Programme are long-term cooperation instruments that serve as umbrella for regular or recurrent operating grants to non-profit making entities which are involved in the development, implementation and enforcement of EU legislation and policy and which are primarily active in the field of environment or climate action, including clean energy transition, in line with the objectives of the LIFE Programme. They are a prerequisite for being able to sign annual Specific Operating Grant Agreements (SGAs), but do not create any legitimate expectations or entitlement to get them.Framework Partnership Agreements that will be concluded following the 2024 Call for Proposals for LIFE Operating Grant Framework Partnership Agreements will cover the following two financial years of beneficiary organisations (i.e. FY 2025 and FY 2026).Framework Partnerships are always mono-beneficiary. Further details can be found in the call document.
Expected Impact:Framework Partnership Agreements for non-profit making entities under the LIFE programme aim to strengthen the participation of civil society in the EU policy dialogue, as well as to support implementation and enforcement of Union environmental and climate objectives, including clean energy transition, by the beneficiaries.

Description: 
Objective:3. CERV-2024-CITIZENS-REM-HISTMIGRATION - Migration, de-colonisation and multicultural European societiesMigration, de-colonisation, slavery, and imperialism are embedded in the European history, and all have profound consequences for society today.Migration has a long and varied history in Europe but is often treated solely as a present- day phenomenon. However, population movements in Europe, from economic migration to expulsion and deportation, from fleeing violence and persecution to migration after EU accession have marked recent European history. Migration is multi-faceted and the experiences of migration into, out of or within Europe are lessons for future generations.Forced migration, internal displacement and expulsion is an experience shared by many Europeans during the period of war, as visible again due to the Russian aggression against Ukraine.Colonialism, slavery, and imperialism have left a mark on global history. Prejudices and stereotypes can be addressed by acknowledging the historical roots of racism, including from an intersectional perspective. De-colonisation, the dismantlement of colonial empires particularly in the 20th century and the emerging post-colonial European societies are shaped by this experience until today. While for many, colonialism is considered a chapter in history, the consequences of imperialistic rule inside and outside Europe are felt still today and are intertwined with structural racism and discrimination. However, these debates have been absent for far too long and need to be firmly embedded in a European narrative. Ensuring remembrance is an important part of encouraging inclusion and understanding.As a way to contribute to the objectives of the EU Anti-Racism Action Plan 2020-2025, projects under this priority should explore the legacy of colonialism, inside and outside Europe, and its impact on contemporary multicultural European societies. Topics such as discrimination and racism are still linked with these experiences and play a major role in European memory throughout most of EUâ€™s societies.In line with the EU Roma Strategic Framework for equality, inclusion and participation, projects can also raise awareness of Roma history and culture as a way to contribute to strengthening multicultural European societies.Projects under this priority can also deal with common European experiences of migration that can be linked to a multitude of events such as wars, transition moments, colonisation and de-colonisation, economic impacts, persecution, or others.For further information about the call and its conditions, please see the Call document.

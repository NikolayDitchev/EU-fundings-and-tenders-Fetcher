Description: 
Objective:Despite the extensive use of COTS UAS in recent conflicts and continued technological development, these systems serve the purpose of rapid and relatively low-cost deployment of assets and effectors in times of extreme need. As with all such systems, there is a lack of key requirements and an overall development and sustainability frameworks that meets the real needs of defence users at the tactical level in the EU Member States and EDF Associated Countries. It should be noted, however, that large UAS are always challenging to operate due to their specific needs, e.g., regarding facilities, maintenance and support.Anticipated advances in miniaturisation and communication protocols are likely to provide sufficient ground for improvements in the area of small UAS for defence applications and their associated payloads, including weapons, without the stringent need for large UAS. Such activities are embedded in very promising prospects for further industrial and operational development.Against this background, this topic aims to have a direct impact on the tactical operational effectiveness of armed forces in multi-domain operations (air, land and maritime). In addition, the outcome of this topic is also expected to improve the intervention capacity of relevant national or European agencies.Specific objectiveIn particular, this topic intends to contribute to address the following specific challenges that small UAS are prone to:Low UAS signatures and extended operational ranges;Operate autonomously and automatic, including with assisted piloting considerations;Miniaturisation of sensors and payloads, including potential weapons and communication systems;Operational capability and survivability in contested, congested and challenging (e.g., weather) airspace. 
Scope:Proposals must address the development of a small UAS with advanced ISTAR capabilities, such as real-time imagery intelligence, and possibly kinetic capabilities, capable of operating in support of the widest possible range of military operations.In addition, proposals should address the development of a multi-role approach that explores compatibility between different payloads and configurations, in particular through an Interoperable Modular and Scalable Architecture (IMOSA) approach to allow interchangeability of components and interoperability between different solutions, including a “plug and play” capability for sensors and possible effectors.As the small UAS cannot support sets of different sensors due to weight, space and power limitations, the possibility of standard interfaces should be explored to allow the selection and integration of a variety of specific sensors to be used in different configurations depending on the mission, and to facilitate the use in defence, civil and dual-use configurations.In addition, proposals may also address the potential synergy for use by law enforcement and other governmental use.Types of activitiesThe following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and whether they are mandatory or optional (see Article 10(3) EDF Regulation):          Types of activities (art 10(3) EDF Regulation)      Eligible?

Supply carrier and precision delivery: The system may include the following capabilities:   Airborne launched capability;Automated delivery of cargo;Beacon capability for discoverability.    Miniaturised weaponry: The development of miniaturised weapons may be considered to eventually get weapon-capable small UAS, hence paving the way for a solution to develop small kinetic capability against e.g., lightly armoured targets, including e.g., loitering munitions, small calibre guided missiles and small calibre torpedoes.CBRN surveillance: The developed small UAS may be able to have a standoff or remote CBRN detector as a payload to allow remote detection of CBRN threats, alerting the unit to the proximity of a contaminated threat and allowing time to take protective action.

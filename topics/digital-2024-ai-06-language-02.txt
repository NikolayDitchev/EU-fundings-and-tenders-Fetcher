Description: 
ExpectedOutcome:DeliverablesAn improved EU-wide digital infrastructure for Language Technologies. A strong community with the establishment of a coordination framework for the different stakeholders (e.g., Member States and industry) around relevant European, national and private initiatives for large language models. 
Objective:Through federating Member States efforts, this action will directly contribute to preserving the linguistic and cultural diversity in Europe while effectively implementing the European Common Data Infrastructure and Service MCP’s objectives in the area of language technologies. By providing the necessary data and model adaptation capacities, the action will have a strong impact on the deployment of large language foundation models and their applications such as generative AI. This federated effort will be established around two work strands.Second work strand - EcosystemThe second work strand will support the coordination of a European Language Technologies ecosystem. This activity will bring together public and private organisations to provide infrastructure and support to developers and users of large language models, especially SMEs.
Scope:The infrastructure will act as advisory point, offer awareness raising and community building. It will support SMEs to onboard the large language models in their production workflows. The work will be carried out in close collaboration with national initiatives, the Data Spaces, the AI on demand platform, Testing and Experimentation Facilities, Digital Innovation Hubs, the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking’s supercomputing facilities and in synergy with the open-source foundation model action. The consortium that will implement this action should be composed by representatives of Member States.

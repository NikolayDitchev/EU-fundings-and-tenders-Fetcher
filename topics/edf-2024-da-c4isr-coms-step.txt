Description: 
Objective:5G is a technology originally developed to address the ongoing rapid pace of digital transformation of the different vertical industries in the civilian world. It is continuously being developed through standardisation activities in 3GPP, and new releases with extended features of the standard are approved approximately every 18 to 24 months.To ensure a technological edge in military use of 5G, it is important to capitalise on the continued momentum of new releases and associated features relevant for military operations. In 2016, resilience in civil communication systems was listed by NATO as one of seven baseline requirements that each Member State should measure their level of preparedness. In November 2019, this requirement was updated by NATO Defence Ministers, who stressed the need for reliable communications including 5G.To address this statement and ensure a higher degree of robustness and resilience in military operations when operating in the tactical edge, the militaries should be able to exploit and seamlessly interact with civilian infrastructure to ensure uninterrupted services for tactical command and control applications.This topic focuses on system level integration and orchestration of 5G technologies for seamless interaction of private military and public 5G networks. Hence, the overall objective is to support the need for an always connected concept enabling military applications to roam securely through a mix of private and public networks. To achieve this, there is a need to study, develop and demonstrate how the military can exploit seamless and uninterrupted transfer of secure applications and services in a coverage area served by a mix of private military and public 5G networks, including BLoS (Beyond Line of Sight) through Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) communication systems integrated in 3GPP standard.Specific objectiveThe specific challenge of this topic is to demonstrate robust and dynamic operational capabilities of 5G connectivity solutions matching the military needs for tactical command and control applications and services.The solution should always be connected via a hybrid form of networks, while ensuring secure communications, using tactical networks, private military and public 5G networks and other federation solutions. The use of flexible reach back solutions such as 5G NTN is also necessary to reach shared centralised cloud services.Within this context, secure integration of commercial and military hardware, software and services is a fundamental challenge that must be addressed on both a technological and a commercial level.
Scope:Proposals must address the development of either integrated private-public 5G system architectures for military operations, or private military 5G networks, or public 5G services for military applications.Moreover, proposals should lead to the development and demonstration of case-agnostic technical products and services, applicable to military operations across all dimensions of warfare. The demonstrations should be performed in relevant operational environments and cover all aspects from devices, infrastructure, security, and simplified orchestration of the overall system.Types of activitiesThe following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and whether they are mandatory or optional (see Article 10(3) EDF Regulation):          Types of activities (art 10(3) EDF Regulation)      Eligible?

Description: 
Objective:The performance of land combat systems has proved decisive in recent conflicts, since the availability of mobile (tactical and strategical mobility) precision systems able to provide the necessary high degree of accuracy, efficiency and reactivity, are becoming increasingly important to avoid widespread collateral damage and reduce exposure of friendly forces. In particular, it is essential for Member States’ armed forces to provide combat units with increased engagement capabilities without being spotted and with a high level of success and survivability.Specific objectiveBeyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) engagement is the capability of firing at a target not directly seen by the effector, based on information given by a remote sensor. The Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) capability offers tactical advantages, as mobile units acquire an increased engagement capability with higher kill probability and without being spotted by the adversary.To succeed in a BLOS-firing mission, reconnaissance, intelligence, and adequate preparations is likely essential. A technical system design (i.e., incorporating command and control, mobility, survivability, lethality, intelligence and endurance) for BLOS must be versatile against future alterations pending an evolving hostile threat. A BLOS system design therefore needs to be future-proof regarding robustness and security to motivate investments in resources and funds for the anticipated period of life.In this context, some requirements are becoming increasingly important: provide the land and coastal combat units with an increased engagement capability and with a very high degree of success and survivability; discriminate between threats that are not always clearly identified and visible before firing; defeat targets that may mask or unmask at the last moment; avoid widespread collateral damage; providing conditions for a high level of survivability by low exposure as well as reachability with precision strikes over an area.
Scope:Proposals must address:the development of innovative technologies of interest to improve the performance of the capability;the update of BLOS collaborative close combat architecture for the integration of new technologies / capabilities;the development of effect management functions for BLOS capability;the development or the integration of a BLOS battlefield training system for collaborative training indoor, outdoor and being able to use force on force;the development of a common interface concept for dismounted system integration in light and medium vehicles and system compatibility with, but not limited to, ring mounted version;the demonstration of a BLOS collaborative engagement that:   should include firing from a dismounted version (possibly mounted on a light vehicle);may include firing from a BLOS system integrated into a battlefield vehicle (deployed in a tactical situation).

Design:   Develop technologies suite to reach TRL 6.Preliminary definition and design of the final product and technology.Detailed definition of the final product and technology.Critical Design Review (CDR).Testing of product, tangible or intangible component or technology.     The proposals should substantiate synergies and complementarities with foreseen, ongoing or completed activities, notably those described in the call topics EDF-2021-GROUND-D-3CA on BLOS collaborative close combat architecture and EDIDP-NGPSC-2019 on Upgrade of current and development of next generation ground-based precision strike capabilities.Moreover:projects addressing activities referred to in point (d) above must be based on harmonised defence capability requirements jointly agreed by at least two Member States or EDF associated countries (or, if studies within the meaning of point (c) are still needed to define the requirements, at least on the joint intent to agree on them)projects addressing activities referred to in points (e) to (h) above, must be:   supported by at least two Member States or EDF associated countries that intend to procure the final product or use the technology in a coordinated manner, including through joint procurement     and   based on common technical specifications jointly agreed by the Member States or EDF associated countries that are to co-finance the action or that intend to jointly procure the final product or to jointly use the technology (or, if design within the meaning of point (d) is still needed to define the specifications, at least on the joint intent to agree on them).     For more information, please check section 6.  Functional requirementsThe proposed product and technologies should meet the following functional requirements:The architecture should allow Collaborative Close Combat using Line of Sight (LOS) or BLOS firing modes at different ranges and using mounted, dismounted and integrated European missile systems.The BLOS system should be coordinated at a tactical level.The system should operate with cooperation means such as a communication network of participants or the European Battle Management Systems.The system should allow for employment within land and amphibious/littoral naval force structures, e.g., light and motorised infantry, mechanised units, and amphibious assault units.The system should be quick into and out of engagements (BLOS and LOS) with a short time from transport, through deployment, preparations, engagement and redeployment, allowing for use in highly dynamic manoeuvre scenarios.Design should consider common maintenance concepts for cost-effective solutions for availability within Europe.The BLOS system should be reliable and safe.The data links should be cyber robust, the cyber aspects being fully controlled by Member States.The system should be capable of operating in climate zones that are of interest to the EU Member States and EDF Associated Countries with a “one applies to all” way of usage.Effect management functions should be explored and possibly improved.The system should provide automated deployment and engagement planning support.The system should be able to operate in a Global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-denied environment.The BLOS system should have an associated battlefield training system for indoor and outdoor exercises with focus on force-to-force training.System design should take into account forces’ limited availability of time for training to operate the capability.The system should allow for robust positioning, navigation and guidance.The system should provide automated support for target detection and acquisition.When doing re-design and design, concern should be taken to existing concepts to minimise the cost of ownership for future upgrades of the capability. 
Expected Impact:The outcome is expected to contribute to: Bring a significant operational differentiator and contribute to enhanced interoperability between armed forces of Member States;Develop and increase the maturity of innovative technologies specifically adapted to BLOS engagement;Increase EU industry capabilities on BLOS architecture, components and technologies;Consolidate European business consortium able to offer competitive solutions for the global market;Decrease dependence on non-EU technologies and products.

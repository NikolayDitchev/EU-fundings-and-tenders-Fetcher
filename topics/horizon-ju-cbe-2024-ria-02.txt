Description: 
ExpectedOutcome:In line with the objectives of the Circular Economy[1] and Zero Pollution Action Plan[2], as well as the Farm to Fork Strategy[3], the successful proposals will contribute to the development of sustainable bio-based products. Successful proposals will also contribute to the implementation of the EU Bioeconomy Strategy[4] and the updated EU Industrial Strategy[5].Project results should contribute to the following expected outcomes:Novel, scalable and more sustainable biotech production routes for bio-based and non-animal-derived chemicals and/or materials replacing animal-derived ones.Performance(s) of bio-based chemicals and/or materials meeting end users’ requirements for final products.Availability of safe and sustainable by design bio-based products.Positive socio-economic impacts along the value chain, from feedstock suppliers to chemicals and materials producers to end users.Social acceptance of circular bio-based solutions and products. 
Scope:Several industries (examples being in, cosmetics ingredients, but also in textile, leather, chemical and material production) utilise animal-derived raw materials as a basis to produce a wide range of products. Examples include hormones, amino acids/peptides, animal oils and fats, fibres, casein, collagen, bone, blood, feathers, leather, etc. Animal derivatives are often characterised by a variable composition and pose sustainability issues due to land use for feed and animal breeding and related environmental footprint but also the animal welfare concerns. There is a growing consumer awareness and drive to move away from animal-derived products in mass-market products. Moreover, the possible presence of pathogens is a critical issue which impacts safety and requires costly downstream purification. Plant-based, fungi-, algae or microbial streams and related side-streams can provide a safer, more sustainable and consistent alternative.Proposals under this topic should:Develop biotech routes for sustainable bio-based alternatives to (a set of) animal-derived product(s). Define, develop and test the related biotech routes and subsequent downstream (separation, purification) up to pilot scale (TRL 5). While the focus of this action is on bio-based materials and/or chemicals, co-production of other bio-based ingredients (including for food and feed) is in scope, fulfilling the cascading approach for maximum valorisation of the feedstock. Any non animal-based biomass feedstock in the scope of the CBE JU is considered in scope for this topic.Characterise the properties of the resulting bio-based material(s)/chemical(s); address validation into final product(s) to test compatibility with market requirements.Assess the compatibility with relevant norms and regulations, including Health&amp;Safety aspects when considering consumer applications.Include a task to integrate a prospective assessment based on the safe-and-sustainable-by-design (SSbD) framework, developed by the European Commission, for assessing the safety and sustainability of chemicals and materials.[6] Under this context, projects are expected to contribute with and develop recommendations that can advance further the application of the SSbD framework[7].Perform a socio-economic impact assessment identifying challenges and opportunities across new and existing value chains.Involve end users starting from the early stages of development to assess market acceptance of the newly developed bio-based materials/products. When addressing consumer products, involve consumers in the testing and validation phase. Proposals must implement the multi-actor approach and ensure adequate involvement of all key actors in the value chains relevant for this topic, across the sustainable circular bio-based system. in particular, involve end users (e.g., consumers and brand owners) or other stakeholders such as NGOs and regulatory actors.Proposals should also describe their contribution to the Specific CBE JU requirements, presented in section 2.2.3.1 of the CBE JU Annual Work Programme 2024[8].Proposals should seek for links and complementarities and avoid overlaps with past, ongoing and upcoming EU funded projects, including those funded under H2020, HEU and the BBI JU and CBE JU. Collaboration among projects from the same topic are encouraged.

Recommendations should also include identification of data gaps, especially safety, environmental, but also socio-economic factors, as well as priorities for data collection.[8]https://www.cbe.europa.eu/reference-documents

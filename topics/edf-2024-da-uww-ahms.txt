Description: 
Objective:Uncrewed systems are a familiar asset in naval capabilities, and they are being increasingly adopted. These types of assets and the technologies that go with them have the potential to offer a diverse mission set, minesweeping being one of them. The maritime drones and their payloads currently used and integrated by the navies operate with different levels of autonomy and endurance. This topic aims to enhance naval minesweeping capabilities by pushing the design and level of the autonomy of particularly maritime drones. Furthermore, this topic addresses sweep gear and sweep sources for minesweeping operations adjoining the higher level of autonomy. In this context the drone/platform and its payload/sweeping gear form the minesweeping system.Minesweeping is traditionally performed using mechanical or influence sweep sources towed behind a highly specialised and expensive crewed platform (minesweeper). Evolving technologies, such as autonomous features, offer new solutions to the minesweeping systems. These solutions in concert with new operational concepts offer European navies the opportunity to maximise the benefits of common development. Typically, a distinction can be made between drones with towed signature sources and those with integrated sources installed aboard.The size and capability of a minesweeping drone and its payload are defined by the operational needs. These needs vary in environmental aspects from inshore operations with short transit and limited operation times in sheltered areas to operations in unsheltered areas potentially exposed to heavy wind and large waves with long standoff distances. The variation in operational needs with respect to the subject of protection can be from smaller merchant vessels and military vessels with reduced underwater signatures to large civilian merchants with significant underwater signatures.The underwater signature and the shock resistance of the minesweeping system is a crucial part of its design and a fundamental feature of minesweeping operations.The objective of this call is to reach at least technology readiness level 6 for a minesweeping system (platform/drone and payload designed for it).
Scope:The proposals must target minesweeping systems (platform/drone and payload/sweeping gear) with autonomous features that are capable of performing influence sweeping in open-sea conditions against mines that target large merchant vessels (such as Landing Platform Dock (LPD), Ro-Ro vessels etc. up to around 200m length). The proposals must investigate and develop capable and cost-effective drone systems for influence minesweeping. This includes the interfaces to enabling systems such as launch and recovery (LARS) of the sweep system and command and control (C2) systems (including planning and evaluation tools).The proposals may include solutions that include modified mechanical minesweeping operations.Furthermore, the proposals must address reducing time (improved effectiveness) and risk for personnel and materiel in minesweeping operations. Development of uncrewed systems and autonomous features are seen as enablers in this regard. Improvements must address at least vehicle design regarding underwater signatures, propulsion system, and shock resistance to benefit both operational quality and efficiency. Improvements should also address features such as low maintenance effort, survivability, endurance, and modularity.The proposals should address multi-purpose functions with the aim of supporting additional Naval Warfare operations, such as, but not limited to, Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Intelligence, surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), and Maritime Evacuation Operations. This may imply that features, such as, but not limited to, LARS, interaction with several autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), operation in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) denied environments, towing of sonar systems, and use of mine disposal systems are incorporated.The outcome should benefit a European interoperable and interchangeable NMCM Future Sweeping System designed with incremental capabilities to counter current and new mine threats consisting of enhanced intelligent platforms. Furthermore, the outcome should address the development of influence sweep source demonstrators for relevant underwater signatures (such as acoustic, magnetic, pressure and electric).Types of activitiesThe following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and whether they are mandatory or optional (see Article 10(3) EDF Regulation):          Types of activities (art 10(3) EDF Regulation)      Eligible?

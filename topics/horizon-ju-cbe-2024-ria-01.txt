Description: 
ExpectedOutcome:In line with the objectives of the Circular Economy[1] and Zero Pollution Action Plan[2], the EU Forest Strategy[3] and the Waste Framework Directive[4], the successful proposals will facilitate the deployment of sustainable bio-based solutions based on recovery and recycling of post-consumer wood streams. Successful proposals will also contribute to the implementation of the EU Bioeconomy Strategy[5] and the updated EU Industrial Strategy[6].Project results should contribute to the following expected outcomes:New systems combing sorting, cleaning and valorisation of post-consumer and post-industrial wood waste into eco-designed sustainable bio-based products.New cross-sectoral and multidisciplinary approach fostering the development of innovative circular business models through the cooperation among different actors.Decreased wood waste to landfill, incineration and all unsustainable practices, and associated environmental impacts.Decontaminated wood waste validated as suitable feedstock for products in at least two application sectors.Social acceptance of circular bio-based solutions and products. 
Scope:Post-consumer and post-industrial wood waste is an abundant secondary feedstock mainly coming from construction and furniture, but also secondary packaging. Policies around Europe are prompting separate collection and recycling of wood waste. Despite the great potential of urban and industrial wood waste to be exploited through a circular bioeconomy approach, this complex waste stream is difficult to be recycled/reprocessed, as it often features contaminants in the form of additives (glues, varnishes, paints, additives, etc..), pollutants (wood treatment products and heavy metals), and contaminating materials (glass, plastics, metals, etc.).Proposals under this topic should:Develop innovative, adaptive/flexible, sustainable and efficient technologies for separating wood content derived from industrial and post-consumer wood waste streams[7] from impurities, pollutants and contaminants[8]. Examples of such wood waste streams include wood from furniture; construction and demolition waste; pallets; boxes and crates and many others. Develop sustainable valorisation/conversion/recycling routes for decontaminated wood waste into bio-based intermediates/chemicals/materials/products.Assess the reduced environmental impacts and the increased circularity in the developed treatment of the selected wood waste streams, also in comparison with the current treatments, if possible.Target at least two different applications/sectors considering economic viability and environmental sustainability.Describe how contaminants will be safely and sustainably isolated and treated. When applicable, assess and develop processes for treatment and potential valorisation of organic and/or inorganic contaminants.Consider health and safety (H&amp;S) aspects including safety of end-users and operators;Perform a survey of the current regulatory framework ruling the management and valorisation of wood waste at EU level and provide recommendations to address potential bottlenecks.Include a task to integrate assessment based on the safe-and-sustainable-by-design (SSbD) framework, developed by the European Commission, for assessing the safety and sustainability of chemicals and materials.[9] Under this context, projects are expected to contribute with and develop recommendations that can advance further the application of the SSbD framework[10]. Proposals must apply the concept of ‘multi-actor approach’ and ensure adequate involvement of all key actors in the value chains relevant for this topic, across the sustainable circular bio-based system, including local communities, municipalities, waste management companies and consumers (when targeting B2C products).Proposals should seek for links and complementarities and avoid overlaps with past, ongoing and upcoming EU funded projects, including those funded under H2020, HEU and the BBI JU and CBE JU[11]. Moreover, projects should consider liaising with P4P and NEB initiative.Proposals should also describe their contribution to the Specific CBE JU requirements, presented in section 2.2.3.1 of the CBE JU Annual Work Programme 2024[12].

Recommendations should also include identification of data gaps, especially safety, environmental, but also socio-economic factors, as well as priorities for data collection.[11]Example of previous or ongoing projects: EcoReFibre (HORIZON-CL4-2021-RESILIENCE-01), WOODCIRCUS (HORIZON 2020-SC5-2018-1), BioREG (H2020-BB-2016-2017).

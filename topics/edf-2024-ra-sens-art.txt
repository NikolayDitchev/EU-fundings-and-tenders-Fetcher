Description: 
Objective:New types of threats are difficult to detect and track, in particular those with stealth characteristics, hypersonic speeds, slow airborne motion, small highly manoeuvring and when saturation attack tactics are used. Facing such threats, existing surveillance radar systems are reaching their limits in terms of detection range, angular domain coverage, tracking and recognition capabilities. Consequently, the objective of this topic is to mature the required technologies and concepts to cover the need for situational awareness by achieving advanced high-performance and a highly integrated multifunction system that may support radar, electronic warfare (EW) and possibly communication functions when feasible and advantageous, enabled through the development of active electronically scanned array (AESA) antennas.Specific objectiveThis topic addresses the maturation of new RF sensor technologies, such as, but not limited to, high-power, high-frequency (up to Ka band), multi and wide band operation both active and passive, adaptive waveform design, modern AESA antennas with digital beam-forming, advanced resource management, innovative signal processing and spectrum-sensing techniques, multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) radar, multi-static configurations and cognitive capabilities with for instance Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML). The aim is to render radars highly versatile and adaptive, while being compatible with operational constraints in terms of performance, size, weight, power consumption and cost (SWaPC).These advances are expected to continue paving the way for more integrated capabilities with respect to radiofrequency (RF), microwaves and electronics, permitting the integration of the functions of radar, electronic warfare and desirably communications into existing or new platforms when feasible and advantageous. The specific understanding, development and management of AESA antennas is essential in this regard.
Scope:Proposals must address research on innovative RF sensor technologies able to improve the performance of current radar systems and deepen into the concept of multifunctional capabilities when feasible and efficient.As agreed with supporting Member States and EDF Associated Countries, challenging scenarios must be proposed, Associated Countries, after being analysed by using different combinations of radar techniques and selected as the most appropriate solutions in terms of performance, feasibility and cost. In that regard, the proposals should consider active and/or passive RF systems, stationary and/or mobile, single band and/or multiband using a wide coverage of the spectrum, multiplatform, adaptive and flexible with cognitive capabilities that suppose a strong impact and significant effects in the theatre of operations, increasing survivability, interoperability and resilience of the EU Member States’ and EDF Associated Countries’ Armed Forces.This set of technologies should be conceived to be integrated in different platforms and with the capacity to be part of a network able to cover wider areas and work synergistically in order to improve the detection, tracking and identification capabilities of challenging targets. Examples of those are the stealthy ones (low RCS), tactical ballistic missiles (TBM) and hypersonic missiles, or when saturation attack tactics are used and targets are immersed in clutter or protected by jamming.Proposals should not address the network aspects.The improvement of the technological enablers of the AESA antennas should be covered as a mean to allow the multifunctional concepts and improve the general performance of the radar against new types of threats.Types of activitiesThe following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and whether they are mandatory or optional (see Article 10(3) EDF Regulation):          Types of activities (art 10(3) EDF Regulation)      Eligible?

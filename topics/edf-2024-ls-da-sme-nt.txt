Description: 
Objective:This call topic encourages the driving role of innovative SMEs to turn technology and research results into defence products in a fast and cost-efficient way, possibly by adapting technologies from civil applications or addressing hybrid warfare.
Scope:The proposals must address innovative defence products, solutions and technologies, including those that can improve readiness, deployability, reliability, safety and sustainability of forces in defence tasks and missions, for example in terms of operations, equipment, infrastructure, energy solutions, surveillance systems or digital solutions.The proposals may address any area of interest for defence, such as, but not limited to, the following ones:Measurement and monitoring of physiological and cognitive state;Optimisation of cognitive performance in human-machine interaction, including for human-robot teaming;Blockchain applications (e.g. for Identification of Friend or Foe);Tools and applications improving cybersecurity talents screening;Artificial intelligence and robotic autonomous systems;System health monitoring and through life-cycle interoperability;Solutions for mechanical and “green” chemical recycling of waste of soldier individual equipment (uniforms, helmets, boots, rucksacks, plastic elements, harness, etc.);Concepts and corresponding technologies to ensure a safe water reuse throughout the entire water cycle of a deployable camp or a deployed combat group, including with microbial safety and hygiene considerations;Synthetic fuel production from waste and biomass for military use;High Power Microwave (HPM) Electronic Waveform Technology countering electronic systems;Technologies for advanced Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) for defence electronics. In addition, in order to best complement R&amp;D efforts already targeting civil applications and to encourage the efficient spinning-in of knowledge, innovation and technological development to the defence sector, this topic also welcomes proposals for add-on development actions to adapt solutions originally developed for civil applications and previously not applied in defence sector.Types of activitiesThe following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic (see Article 10(3) EDF Regulation):          Types of activities (art 10(3) EDF Regulation)      Eligible?                (a)      Activities that aim to create, underpin and improve knowledge, products and technologies, including disruptive technologies, which can achieve significant effects in the area of defence (generating knowledge)      No            (b)      Activities that aim to increase interoperability and resilience, including secured production and exchange of data, to master critical defence technologies, to strengthen the security of supply or to enable the effective exploitation of results for defence products and technologies (integrating knowledge)      Yes            (c)      Studies, such as feasibility studies to explore the feasibility of new or upgraded products, technologies, processes, services and solutions      Yes            (d)      Design of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology as well as the definition of the technical specifications on which such a design has been developed, including any partial test for risk reduction in an industrial or representative environment      Yes            (e)      System prototyping[1] of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology      Yes            (f)      Testing of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology      Yes            (g)      Qualification[1] of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology      Yes            (h)      Certification[1] of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology      Yes            (i)      Development of technologies or assets increasing efficiency across the life cycle of defence products and technologies      Yes       The proposals must address at least one activity among design, system prototyping, testing, qualification, certification and increasing efficiency.The proposals must describe a clear work breakdown structure and link the proposed tasks to eligible activities.The proposals should include clear descriptions of the proposed criteria to assess work package completion.Moreover:projects addressing activities referred to in point (d) above must be based on harmonised defence capability requirements jointly agreed by at least two Member States or EDF associated countries (or, if studies within the meaning of point (c) are still needed to define the requirements, at least on the joint intent to agree on them)projects addressing activities referred to in points (e) to (h) above, must be:   supported by at least two Member States or EDF associated countries that intend to procure the final product or use the technology in a coordinated manner, including through joint procurement     and   based on common technical specifications jointly agreed by the Member States or EDF associated countries that are to co-finance the action or that intend to jointly procure the final product or to jointly use the technology (or, if design within the meaning of point (d) is still needed to define the specifications, at least on the joint intent to agree on them).      For more information, please check section 6 of the Call document.Functional requirementsThis call topic is open to any technology development for defence. The proposals should describe the targeted functionalities and the foreseen means to measure progress toward the achievements of these functionalities.Specific topic conditionsFor this topic, multi-beneficiary applications are mandatory and specific conditions for the consortium composition apply (see section 6 of the Call document)For this topic, there is a fixed subcontracting limit of 30% (see section 10 of the Call document)For this topic, the following reimbursement option for equipment costs applies: depreciation and full cost for listed equipment (see section 10 of the Call document). 
Expected Impact:Innovative, rapid and cost-effective solutions for defence applications;Ground-breaking or novel concepts and approaches, new promising future technological improvements or the application of technologies or concepts previously not applied in the defence sector;Enhanced innovation capacity across Europe by involvement of SMEs that can make a difference in the future;Potential for future market creation for SMEs, especially by facilitating access of SMEs to defence markets and supply chains;Contribution to the development of European technological and industrial ecosystems and to the strengthening of European defence supply chains.

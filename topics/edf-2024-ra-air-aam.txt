Description: 
Objective:Air-to-air combat is a challenging and interdisciplinary field in a high-threat and time-critical environment. The air-to-air missiles currently in service are generally of a good technological standard. However, the requirements for all aspects of such missiles are constantly increasing in number and complexity. Given this environment, it is conceivable that future air-to-air missiles will need to be designed and operate differently.The key challenge is to prepare for the development of a missile that can counter future air threats on an economically viable basis.Specific objectiveThe main objective is therefore to develop at European level concepts and operational requirements for a short-range air-to-air missile (SRAAM) to primarily counter modern 5th and future 6th generation combat aircraft and other airborne threats, such as UAS and cruise missiles. Opportunities and limitations are to be explored in various disciplines, such as image processing, target detection, navigation sensors, missile hardware related to kinematic properties, propulsion, warhead unit design, missile guidance, missile control, multi-sensor data fusion, missile computer architecture design, advanced materials (e.g., morphing materials), new production techniques and network integration.The research activities performed are expected to mature relevant technologies up to TRL 5-6.
Scope:Proposals must address the definition of requirements for a Future Short-Range Missile (FSRM) to be primarily used on combat aircraft for air-to-air applications, as well as a modular interceptor concept to minimise impact on aircraft integration and maximise internal carriage capacity.In addition, proposals must address the possibility to use the FSRM or its components for a ground-based air defence application.The proposals may also explore combined mode operations (i.e., air-to-air and air-to-ground) for the FSRM.Types of activitiesThe following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and whether they are mandatory or optional (see Article 10(3) EDF Regulation):          Types of activities (art 10(3) EDF Regulation)      Eligible?                (a)      Activities that aim to create, underpin and improve knowledge, products and technologies, including disruptive technologies, which can achieve significant effects in the area of defence (generating knowledge)      Yes(optional)            (b)      Activities that aim to increase interoperability and resilience, including secured production and exchange of data, to master critical defence technologies, to strengthen the security of supply or to enable the effective exploitation of results for defence products and technologies (integrating knowledge)      Yes(optional)            (c)      Studies, such as feasibility studies to explore the feasibility of new or upgraded products, technologies, processes, services and solutions      Yes(mandatory)            (d)      Design of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology as well as the definition of the technical specifications on which such a design has been developed, including any partial test for risk reduction in an industrial or representative environment      Yes(optional)            (e)      System prototyping of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology      No            (f)      Testing of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology      No            (g)      Qualification of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology      No            (h)      Certification[1] of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology      No            (i)      Development of technologies or assets increasing efficiency across the life cycle of defence products and technologies      No       Accordingly, the proposals must cover at least the following tasks as part of mandatory activities:Studies:   Analyse the operational requirements for future FSRM, using IR with extended visual range or RF or combining both technologies, to primarily counter modern 5th and future 6th generation combat aircraft and other airborne threats such as UAS and cruise missiles.Analyse readiness and accessibility of relevant technologies in the European market, in particular in the field of target detection, acquisition and tracking, as well as, but not limited to, image processing, infrared imaging seeker, navigation sensors, guidance laws, missile hardware structure, propulsion, war head unit design, fusing, guidance and control, multi-sensor data fusion, missile computer architecture.Define missile concepts and evaluate them against the identified operational requirements, including the use of a standardised missile simulation.Analyse the extent to which the FSRM can be economically viable in terms of low development, maintenance, integration and production costs, with a consistent European supply chain, including during a prolonged active conflict.Analyse the operational and technical requirements for the FSRM or its components to be used for a ground-based air defence application.Analyse the possibility of using a close loop follow on support based on a state-of-the-art prognostics and health management methodology of the FSRM.     In addition, proposals may also analyse any operational and technical requirements in view of possible combined (i.e., air-to-air and air-to-ground) operations for the FSRM.Functional requirementsThe proposed product and technologies should meet the following functional requirements:The envisioned FSRM should achieve a high kill probability against a variety of airborne threats, primarily against modern 5th and future 6th generation combat aircraft as well as UAS and cruise missiles, but other airborne threats may also be considered (e.g., large aircraft, light attack aircraft, helicopters, medium-range air defence missiles, air-to-air missiles and similar threats/objects, etc.);It should include High Off-Boresight (HOBS) abilities and lock-on after launch capabilities;It should be resilient to countermeasures, depending on the technologies foreseen for the FRSM and for the targeted aerial threats;Model assessment should be performed in a simulation-driven environment with digital-twin missile concept. 
Expected Impact:The outcome should contribute to enhancing the readiness of the EU Member States and the European Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB) for any further development of state-of-the-art future air-to-air missiles, by:Boosting missile technology within the EDTIB.Improving the Member States’ and EDF Associated Countries’ understanding of operational requirements for a FSRM, including benefits from key technologies.

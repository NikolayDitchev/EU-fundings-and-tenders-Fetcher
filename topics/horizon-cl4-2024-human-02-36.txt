Description: 
ExpectedOutcome:Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes, in line with the Commission initiative ‘Advanced Materials for industrial leadership’:Well-coordinated European, national and regional initiatives in the field of two-dimensional materials (2DMs) and other advanced materials.Well-coordinated national and regional funding programmes allowing for joint calls between interested countries. Such calls should also offer synergies with projects funded at European level.Contribution to the further development of a strong European innovation ecosystem for R&amp;I in 2DMs and other advanced materials.Assessment by Member States of any technology leakage risks as identified under the Economic Security Communication published in June 2023. 
Scope:Proposals should support the coordination between relevant national and regional public authorities funding research and innovation in 2DM-based technologies and advanced materials. This coordination should allow them to work synergistically with the goal to strengthen and complement the EU funded activities in advanced materials and 2DM-based technologies under Horizon Europe and to leverage future actions beyond 2027.Coordination and support activities should address all of the following:Active networking of relevant initiatives and R&amp;I communities.Active follow-up of the projects funded under FLAG-ERA[1] and M-ERANET[2].Maintaining an inventory of funding and scientific landscapes in Europe in the domain of 2DMs, and more broadly advanced materials, for both basic and applied research.Analysing gaps and overlaps between EU, national and regional funding landscapes, and contributing to topics that could be included in national/regional research agendas, including need for actions related to standardisation and regulatory preparedness.Supporting the national and regional players, e.g. funding bodies, to organise joint calls for proposals between their respective programmes and initiatives for supporting in Europe the further development of a strong innovation ecosystem in 2DMs and advanced materials at large;Assessing technology leakage risks for projects funded under FLAG-ERA and M-ERANET, in line with the Commission recommendation on critical technologies of 13 October 2023, as far as advanced materials are concerned.  Proposals should build on or seek collaboration with existing portfolios of EU projects and develop synergies with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives, funding programmes and platforms and in particular with the Graphene Flagship, AMI 2030 and the new proposed Horizon Europe Partnership on ‘Innovative Materials 4 EU’ and any future European initiative on innovative materials.In this topic, the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.

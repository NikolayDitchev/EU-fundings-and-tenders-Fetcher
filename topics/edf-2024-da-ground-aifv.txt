Description: 
Objective:The Global Strategy for the European Union’s (EU) Foreign and Security Policy defines an integrated approach to conflicts “at all stages of the conflict cycle, acting promptly on prevention, responding responsibly and decisively to crises, investing in stabilisation and avoiding premature disengagement when a new crisis erupts”.In order to support and, if necessary, enforce, the above approach, a credible deterrent is required to be rebuilt in terms of land combat capability with a priority focused on armoured vehicles in general and, in particular, on Armoured Infantry Fighting Vehicles.Specific objectiveArmoured Infantry Fighting Vehicles (AIFV) remain a pivotal element of land military manoeuvre, both in a conventional warfare context as well as in the asymmetric one, thanks to the combination of protection, mobility, and firepower. Nonetheless, AIFVs currently numbered in the fleet inventories of the EU Member States are to some extent either ageing or obsolete and, therefore, the same States face the compelling need to modernise their in-service platforms and replace those of them approaching the end of their operational life. There is also a need to accelerate the acquisition and increase the size of the AIFV fleets updating some of the new requirements stemming from the war in Ukraine and the new threat scenarios. Against this background, the upgrade of the current and development of the next generation armoured infantry fighting vehicle capable of outstanding operational effectiveness and mission success in all possible future scenarios are highly necessary.Modularity, reduced crew workload, the integration of automatic systems, Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUM-T), and increased survivability must guide design considerations.
Scope:Proposals must address studies and design for the upgrade of current armoured infantry fighting vehicles and the development of next generation armoured infantry fighting vehicle technologies, with desirable outputs for legacy platforms, including enabling and green technologies (eco-design or sustainable technologies), leading to a system level capable of outstanding operational effectiveness and mission success in all possible future scenarios. Furthermore, they must take into account aspects such as mobility, deployability (tactical and strategic ones), autonomy, firepower, maintainability, survivability and cyber security.Thematic scope of the activities to be supported is preliminary studies, system analysis and early development phases. It includes considerations of the system in operational perspective and identification of specific subsystems that define the future operational environment and purpose of system within the future battlefield.Moreover, proposals should include development efforts of a new common European “Armoured Infantry Fighting Vehicle” (AIFV), and when feasible have a high commonality with solutions in other future European combat vehicles.Types of activitiesThe following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and whether they are mandatory or optional (see Article 10(3) EDF Regulation):          Types of activities (art 10(3) EDF Regulation)      Eligible?

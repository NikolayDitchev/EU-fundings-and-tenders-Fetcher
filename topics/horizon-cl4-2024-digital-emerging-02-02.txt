Description: 
ExpectedOutcome:Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:Support to transnational projects in quantum technologies, fostering synergy between European, national and regional initiatives and promoting broader partnerships between the European stakeholders in quantum technologies. 
Scope:Proposals should support the networking and coordination of national activities in support of the Quantum Flagship by implementing calls for proposals resulting primarily in grants to third parties in this area, in accordance with the provisions of the General Annexes. Of importance is how the proposals address: i) the gaps in the Strategic Research Agenda, not covered by the Flagship activities; (ii) support transnational efforts in guaranteeing availability of critical technologies, materials and resources essential for a competitive development of next generation quantum technologies and central to strategic supply chains for an autonomous and technologically sovereign pan-European quantum ecosystem; (iii) support early-stage involvement of industry in transnational R&amp;D agendas to next generation quantum technologies, emphasizing high inclusion and participation of SME and start-ups in realizing an innovative and agile pan-European quantum ecosystem.Proposals should make provisions to actively participate in the common activities of the Quantum Flagship and in particular contribute to the activities of the existing Quantum Coordination and Support Action.
Specific Topic Conditions:Activities are expected to start at TRL 1-4 and achieve TRL up to 6 by the end of the project â€“ see General Annex B

Beneficiaries may provide financial support to third parties.The support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants. The maximum amount to be granted to each third party is EUR 1.000.000[[This maximum amount, however, may be higher if the objective of the action would be impossible or overly difficult to achieve (and duly substantiated).]] in order to allow third parties to achieve closer coordination and greater mobilisation and pooling of resources between regional, national and EU research programmes for realising the research goals of the Quantum Flagship in the area of quantum technologies.Proposals must use financial support to third parties (FSTP) to achieve closer coordination and greater mobilisation and pooling of resources between regional, national and EU research programmes for realising the research goals of the Flagship in the area of quantum technologies. A minimum 85% of the EU funding requested by the proposal must be allocated to the purpose of financial support to third parties, selected through joint calls with the participating national funding agencies.Third parties will be funded through projects of around EUR 2.5 million per project. The funding rate is 33% of the eligible costs as in the previous ERA-NET co-fund actions in support to the Quantum Flagship.

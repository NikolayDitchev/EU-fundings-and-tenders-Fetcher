Description: 
Objective:To cope with multi-dimensional warfighting environments, modern militaries need relevant situational awareness across all domains. They also need to be able to both operate cross-domain capabilities, such as any-sensor-to-any-shooter networking, and prevent the enemy from doing so. This requires communications systems that can perform ad hoc networking in all domains in dynamically evolving tactical situations. Currently, this is done with mobile ad-hoc networking (MANET) data links.As wireless solutions such as the Internet of Battlefield Things proliferate, the electromagnetic spectrum is likely to become an increasingly important source of situational awareness. Passive electronic monitoring, detection, classification and localisation of enemy radio frequency emitters is part of the recognised situational picture. Traditionally, this has been the task of electronic warfare (EW) units and their specific equipment providing electronic support (ES) to combat units.To counter a detected threat, forces can use kinetic- (KE) and directed-energy (DE) means with their weapon systems, or electronic protection (EP) and attack (EA) if they have jamming systems, traditionally equipment carried and used by dedicated EW units. Before directing fire at detected targets, soldiers must mitigate the risk of friendly fire. At long ranges and in poor visibility, this requires radio communications with either self-positioning based Blue Force Tracking (BFT) or interrogation-based Identification Friend or Foe (IFF).Today, MANET data links, ES receivers, jammers, BFT and IFF are separate pieces of equipment requiring decentralised control, separate installation space, power supply, cabling, antennas, etc. By combining these functionalities into a single autonomously controlled equipment, it would be possible to achieve better performance, higher reliability, lower weight and lower life cycle costs.In addition to the aforementioned technological reasons for converged aperture, there is also a need for converged systems. The electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) is expected to continue to be contested, congested and constrained. Military use of the EMS is under serious pressure from the civil community. Civilian, dual-use and military applications intermingle in the EMS currently in use, challenging the freedom and security of operation (OPSEC) of military users. With Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology, systems are likely to be able to dynamically perform mission and threat analysis, situational awareness, positioning and navigation, and jamming. This means dynamic adaptation to prevailing conditions at machine speed. This would require AI-based operation at the device and system of systems (fleet/network) level in order to coordinate actions of several systems with minimal detectability and platform losses.Specific objectiveThe specific objective of this topic is to design, develop and build a system that should:Accelerate command and control (C2) and enhance operational effectiveness by providing cross-domain mobile ad-hoc networking capabilities to the armed forces.Increase lethality by enabling faster firing and reducing the risk of collateral damages, including fratricide, by providing the means to detect and target the enemy and to locate, track and identify friendly forces.Reduce enemy lethality and increase own protection by avoiding detection with AI-based emission control, stealthy waveforms and by jamming enemy communications.Provide autonomous mission management of several systems (including detection, jamming and targeting) within the network in order to improve survivability, and autonomously take actions to meet the mission objectives with the aid of AI.Be capable of operating in all weather conditions, in particular in the challenging Arctic environment and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) denied areas. 
Scope:Proposals must address study, development and qualification of new generation scalable and cognitive (AI-controlled) multifunctional software defined (SD) transceiver for military use in manned and unmanned platforms.

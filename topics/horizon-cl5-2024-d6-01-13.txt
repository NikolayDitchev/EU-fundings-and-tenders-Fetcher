Description: 
ExpectedOutcome:European Commission and EU Member States (MS) and Associated Countries (AC) are reinforcing and developing their research &amp; innovation policy to accelerate zero-emission road mobility development. A framework for cooperation will enhance the efforts to achieve this pan-European challenge by joining forces, sharing knowledge, bundling financial resources and coordinating activities, creating complementarities, coherence and building synergies across the EU (e.g. 2ZERO partnership) and EU Member States (MS) and Associated Countries (AC)´s R&amp;I funding programmes, national plans, efforts, approaches and in collaboration with the Associated Countries.Project results are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:Stronger harmonised national policy plans, efforts, approaches with a focus on R&amp;I funding programmes of the different EU Member States/Associated countries, accelerating zero-emission road mobility.Maximally deployed and effectively utilised synergy effects, pooled resources and aligned R&amp;I funding programmes to support the EU 2030 and 2050 CO2 emission goals for the road mobility sector in an affordable and effective way, in line with the scope of the National Emission Reduction Commitment Directive for all emissions and the Zero Pollution Action Plan.Exchange of knowledge and experiences and mutual coordination at multiple levels (EU/ national / regional / cities and stakeholders, funding organisations, OEMs, fleets, social partners, users, etc.), implementation activities, regulations, incentives and demonstrations and the sharing of data, information and best practices.Provide companies, regions, cities and the research community with a holistic overview of policy plans and R&amp;I funding programmes across EU (and Associated Countries) to maximise synergy effects and the efficient utilisation of resources, such as from recovery packages and cohesion funds.Allow a clear overview of the national projects and better take into account their results in the development of their research and deployment actions.In order to facilitate the above-mentioned coordination of efforts at national and EU level and the sharing of best practices and results, data on national projects (to a level at least equivalent to those present in the CORDIS database) should be made available by EU Member States (MS) and Associated Countries (AC). The consortium will endeavour to promote and harmonise the registration of data on national projects of participating countries, to make data more accessible internationally and to facilitate their exchange and comparison. This will be supporting the integration of data on national projects into existing databases, such as TRIMIS and CORDIS.Long lasting, strong coordination and cooperation between the European Commission, MS and AC and the Stakeholders involved in the 2ZERO Partnership, facilitated by the States Representatives Group (SRG). 
Scope:Although there is a relatively large degree of similarity in the targets and approaches of the EU Member States and Associate Countries to address the climate change and air pollution targets, still considerable differences in the paths can be observed: more coordination and collaboration is urgently needed to promote zero emission road mobility, building on the policy cooperation network of the EU Member States/Associated countries built-up in ERA-NET Transport, Electromobility+ and ERA-NET Co-fund Electric Mobility Europe (EMEurope) with over two decades of experience.Proposals are expected to address all of the following aspectsAddress zero-emission road mobility for people and goods programmes supporting all phases of the innovation: technology development, demonstration, deployment and implementation will be considered.Develop a long-lasting network (beyond the project duration) of public and private stakeholders connecting EU Member States/Associated countries and European initiatives, under the umbrella of the 2ZERO partnership States Representative Group (also building on existing links with the supporting European technology platforms ALICE, ETIP-SNET, EPoSS, ERTRAC and Batteries Europe) to share knowledge, coordinate activities and bundling financial resources to achieve synchronicity, synergies and complementarity in the R&amp;I-related plans, efforts, approaches, incentives and funding programmes to effectively support the EU and national objectives for 2030 and 2050.More concretely contribute to:   Support EU Member States/Associated countries in fostering synergies with the national and regional funding and implementing and accelerating priority actions identified in the 2ZERO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) in coordination with the 2ZERO States Representatives Group.Collect and share, up-to-date and targeted information on European and national R&amp;I funding programmes, demonstration projects and testing activities, test sites, living labs with their features and capabilities, standards, testing and assessment methodologies as well as programmes in the field of zero emission mobility in Europe and beyond.    Exchange knowledge and experiences on zero emission road transport programmes in Europe, building on and connecting existing database platforms, such as TRIMIS, 2ZERO events and conferences, including the H2020RTR series, Member State’s and stakeholder’s information sharing portals. Proposals should consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), whose contribution could consist of supporting the establishment of harmonized and shared national data on projects.This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Towards zero emission road transport’ (2ZERO). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership ‘Towards zero emission road transport’ (2ZERO) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.

Description: 
ExpectedOutcome:In line with the objectives of the Circular Economy[1] and Zero Pollution Action Plan[2], the EU Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability and the Transition Pathway for the Chemical Industry and its co-implementation, the successful proposals will facilitate the deployment of sustainable bio-based adhesives. Successful proposals will also contribute to the implementation of the EU Bioeconomy Strategy[3] and the updated EU Industrial Strategy[4].Project results should contribute to the following expected outcomes:Diversification of the bio-based adhesives and binders product portfolio and increase of their range of application.Product performance meeting market and regulatory requirements.Proof-of-concept demonstration of new bio-based adhesive and binder applications under representative conditions.Improved sustainability and circularity compared to existing market counterparts.Improved health and safety profile compared to existing market products.Increased end user/consumer awareness and acceptance of SSbD bio-based solutions. 
Scope:Adhesives and binders are used in several sectors; their strength, ease of application and stability are of significant help in the manufacture and service of products. However, certain conventional fossil-based products can present significant health and safety and environmental issues at production, use and end of life phases. The chemical composition of and volatile substances released from conventional synthetic adhesives and binders raise health and safety concerns; moreover they are often based on formaldehyde or epoxy resins, some of which are under scrutiny as candidate substances of concern. Bio-based solutions could represent safer alternatives, provided they match application requirements in terms of cost, performance and end of life.Proposals under this topic should:Demonstrate the cost-competitive and resource efficient production of SSbD bio-based adhesives and/or binders, as alternatives to conventional fossil-based chemicals posing environmental and health &amp; safety concerns.Demonstrate that the developed adhesives and/or binders meet target application requirements in terms of technical performances, such as shelf life and durability, load-bearing, fire resistance, resistance to chemicals and temperature, mechanical strength etc. Besides the technical properties of the adhesives and binders, proposals should also consider their application to the final product(s), targeting solutions allowing easy assembly/installation and debonding, as well as compatibility with recycling streams, for improved circularity of the product.Include a task to integrate assessment based on the safe-and-sustainable-by-design (SSbD) framework, developed by the European Commission, for assessing the safety and sustainability of chemicals and materials.[5] Under this context, projects are expected to contribute with and develop recommendations that can advance further the application of the SSbD framework.[6]. Where applicable, a comparison with the fossil-based and/or bio-based state-of-the-art counterparts should be added. Proposals must implement the multi-actor approach and demonstrate the involvement of all concerned key actors in the bio-based systems, such as researchers and technology providers, bio-based processing industries, waste management operators, end-users and consumers.Proposals should seek for links and complementarities and avoid overlaps with past, ongoing and upcoming EU funded projects, including those funded under H2020, HEU and the BBI JU and CBE JU.[7] Collaboration among projects from the same topic are encouraged.Proposals should also describe their contribution to the Specific CBE JU requirements, presented in section 2.2.3.1 of the CBE JU Annual Work Programme 2024[8].

Recommendations should also include identification of data gaps, especially safety, environmental, but also socio-economic factors, as well as priorities for data collection.[7]For example from the BBI JU/CBE JU portfolio, CHAMPION (H2020-BBI-JTI-2019), VIOBOND (H2020-BBI-JTI-2020), VIPRISCAR (H2020-BBI-JTI-2017), SusBind (H2020-BBI-JTI-2017), SuperBark (HORIZON-JU-CBE-2022).[8]https://www.cbe.europa.eu/reference-documents

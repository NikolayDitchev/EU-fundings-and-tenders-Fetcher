Description: 
Objective:In the context of future armed conflicts, hypersonic weapons could increasingly be used against the EU Member States and EDF Associated Countries and circumvent current air and missile defence systems. Numerous models have been developed to describe a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV), but there is a need to further improve knowledge on the HGV threats, notably on the most demanding ones and on the combination of their signatures and kinematic behaviours to successfully detect, track and counter these threats.Specific objectiveAgainst this background, this topic aims to improve the defence capability against HGV threats by collecting all information necessary to successfully counter HGV systems.
Scope:To build a common understanding and classification, proposals must address studies and performance assessment of the most demanding HGV systems, detailing their signature and behaviour depending on their characteristics.Based on the results of these studies, proposals must also design a representative HGV model. This model must be validated in a relevant testing environment, using all the resources made available by supporting EU Member States and EDF Associated Countries. Proposals must address the extraction and processing of relevant signatures and kinematic data, including through at least in-flight demonstration(s) of a simplified basic HGV demonstrator.Types of activitiesThe following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and whether they are mandatory or optional (see Article 10(3) EDF Regulation):          Types of activities (art 10(3) EDF Regulation)      Eligible?

Design:   Design and build up a simplified basic HGV demonstrator.Design a testing environment for the designed simplified basic HGV demonstrator, which should:     use components, facilities and resources provided by the supporting Member States and EDF Associated Countries;be a combination of simulation, ground-based demonstrations and in-flight demonstration(s), where applicable and relevant;be able to collect, extract and process all relevant signatures and kinematic data with a view to validate the model resulting from the studies.      Select and adapt the launcher and booster system, as required for the simplified basic HGV demonstrator, as available to supporting EU Member States and EDF Associated Countries.     In order to ensure no duplication of efforts, the proposals must substantiate synergies and complementarities with foreseen, ongoing or completed activities in the field of air and missile defence, notably those described in the call topics EDIDP-SSAEW-EW-2020 and EDF-2022-DA-SPACE-SBMEW respectively related to Early warning and Space-based missile early warning, as well as EDF-2021-AIRDEF-D-EATMI and in EDF-2023-DA-DS-AIRDEF-EATMI, both related to Endo-atmospheric interceptor – concept phase.Moreover:projects addressing activities referred to in point (d) above must be based on harmonised defence capability requirements jointly agreed by at least two Member States or EDF associated countries (or, if studies within the meaning of point (c) are still needed to define the requirements, at least on the joint intent to agree on them)projects addressing activities referred to in points (e) to (h) above, must be:   supported by at least two Member States or EDF associated countries that intend to procure the final product or use the technology in a coordinated manner, including through joint procurement     and   based on common technical specifications jointly agreed by the Member States or EDF associated countries that are to co-finance the action or that intend to jointly procure the final product or to jointly use the technology (or, if design within the meaning of point (d) is still needed to define the specifications, at least on the joint intent to agree on them).     For more information, please check section 6 of the Call document. Functional requirementsThe proposed product and technologies should meet the following functional requirements:The simplified basic HGV demonstrator to be built and used for the validation of the designed HGV model should:   have main typical characteristics of known HGVs as weapon systems from possible adversaries, in terms of size, symmetry, GNC and payload, but suitable for the validation of the designed representative HGV model;be equipped with a set of various onboard sensors, data-recording systems and other instrumentations to allow the collection of relevant data;include a capability of real-time transmitting of measurement data (e.g. telemetry or datalink system);for in-flight demonstration(s), be launched at the required altitude (between 30 and 80 km during gliding phase) with the velocity between 8 and 12 Mach, using relevant adapted launcher and booster systems.    The testing environment, including at least in-flight demonstration(s) of the simplified basic HGV demonstrator should:   evaluate stable flight and structural endurance for a realistic trajectory with speed in the hypersonic regime;allow to observe, collect and record signatures and kinematic behaviours during the gliding phase with at least two different existing sensors (e.g. Visual, IR with multiple wavelengths from NIR to LWIR, UV, RF with multiple frequencies, etc.);allow to validate the designed representative HGV model.     
Expected Impact:The outcome should contribute to:the reduction of dependencies on non-EU solutions regarding counter hypersonic technologies; increase knowledge on hypersonic threats and technologies with a view to develop an effective European air and missile defence.
